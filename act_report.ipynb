    "Firstly, the dog stages as seen in the fig 1. include pupper, doggo, puppo, floofer. Of the <b> 1,655 </b> data recorded in the final dataset, only <b>257</b> stages were available. For the available stages, puppers accounted accounted for <b>67% (173)</b> of the dogs while doggos came second with <b>21% (54)</b>. Puppos and fluffers completed the set with <b>9%(22)</b> and <b>3%(8)</b> respectively\n",

    "Doggos were a close second, with an average of almost 27,000. Puppers received the least average interactions\n",
