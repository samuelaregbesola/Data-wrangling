# Data Insights and Visualization Report

The WeRateDogs Twitter page is a hub for dog lovers. From unconventional ratings to a lot of
cute dogs, it's avery interactive account. On careful examination of some available tweets,
some insights ere drawn and I would love to share these insights.

Firstly, the dog stages as seen in the fig 1. include pupper, doggo, puppo, floofer. Of
the 1,655 data recorded in the final dataset, only 257 stages were available. For the available
stages, puppers accounted accounted for 67% (173) of the dogs while doggos came second
with 21% (54). Puppos and fluffers completed the set with 9%(22) and 3%(8) respectively.

Secondly, the dog stages with the most interactions (i.e., favorites and retweets) were
examined. Now seeing as the stages were uneven, the average interaction was used to
determine which dogs received the most adoration. Puppos were showered with the most
interaction, averaging close to 30,000 likes and retweets. Doggos were a close second, with
an average of almost 27,000. Puppers received the least average interactions with just over
10,000 likes and retweets.

Finally, the breeds of dogs were examined. Breeds with more than 50 tweets were first
identified. These breeds include Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriver, Pembroke, Chihuahua
and Pug. Retrievers received the most interactions while Pugs received the least interactions.

More insights like the breeds with the highest/lowest ratings together with their visualizations, can
and will be explored in the future. Thank you for reading.
